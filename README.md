## üí° About the project

Welcome to my personal Linktree clone! This is a simple landing page that showcases my online presence with links to my social media profiles, websites, and more. As a beginner in web development, there might be some mistakes in the code, but I've done my best to make it according to my preferences. I've used some workarounds to address certain problems, but I'm confident you'll be able to fix them easily.
- [Demo](https://techvishnu.github.io/links/)

## üöÄ Getting started

If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.
[Download the ZIP from this location](https://github.com/techvishnu/links/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command to clone the files to your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnggli/linktree
```
- Once the files are on your machine, open the _linktree_ folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the **Go Live** button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
- Change the profile image and texts in the `index.html` file.
- Change the colors and fonts in the `style.css` file.
- To change the background, go to the `style.css` file on line 17, uncomment the code snippet and change the url to whatever image you want.
